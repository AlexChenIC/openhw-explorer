## Reuse Guide

### Filter System

All configuration is in `src/data/filters.ts`, covering roles (5), categories (6), core types, and verification types.
Filter logic lives in `filterProjects()` in `src/data/projects.ts` — supports multi-condition stacking and URL state sync.

### Project Mascot

`src/components/RepoMascotMetroZoo.tsx` contains the optional project mascot
presentation used by fun mode.

### Data Structure

Type definitions are in `src/types/index.ts`. To add a project, append an entry conforming to the `Project` interface in the `projects` array in `src/data/projects.ts`.

## Release Notes

Before promoting OpenHW Explorer as a formal public 1.0 release, review
`docs/release-1.0-preflight.md`. That checklist records the required decisions
around brand naming, trademark posture, copyright/license scope, professional
domain setup, third-party attribution, and future paid-course flexibility.
